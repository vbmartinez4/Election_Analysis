## Challange Overview
Seth and Tom sought assistance in determining the winner of the Colorado elections once all of the votes had been collected to provide to the election commission and announce the winner. 
In the first portion of the data collection analysis, the Board had provided us the following tasks to focus on during the first round of the election audit:
    1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast.
    2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received notes.
    3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
    4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
    5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
    
Now having assisted Seth and Tom complete the election audit to determine the winner of Coloradoâ€™s election, the Board would like to investigate even further on the results collected and requested additional data before finalizing their audit. They are now interested in the following: 
    1.	The voter turnout for each county
    2.	The percentage of votes from each county out of the overall total count
    3.	The county with the highest voter turnout in this election

## Election Audit Summary
Now for future elections, the election commission can look to utilize the script with a few modifications to not only continuing analyzing the winner and county voter turnout, but for other factors as well. One way in which this script can be used is what voter turnout count and percentage looks like for each candidate running based in each county. It would help demonstrate which county favored a candidate versus its counterparts. Likewise, another benefit the election commission that would come from using this script is obtaining further statistical data regarding central tendencies such as the mean from each county to observe the average amounts of voters were participating in each election for each county and even the candidates. It would add another perspective getting more granular on the data as to what the average was for a candidate in this county versus their competitor and compare side by side. Bringing it altogether with providing a greater and deeper analysis of the overall election results.
